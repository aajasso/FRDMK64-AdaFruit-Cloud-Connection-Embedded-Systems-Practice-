IoT MQTT Client with DreeRTOS on NXP Cortex-M
This project implements an IoT MQTT client on an NXP Cortex M based microcontroller using FreeRTOS and LwIP.
It connects to Adafruit's MQTT broker and interface with cloud dashboards, publishing sensor data (humidity) and controlling devices (sprinklers).
